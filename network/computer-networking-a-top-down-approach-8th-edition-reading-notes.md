### Computer Networks And The Internet
- **transmission rate**:  measured in **bits/second**.
- units in IT:
  
| Unit | Bytes (decimal) | Bytes (binary) |
|------|-----------------|---------------|
| Kilobyte | 10^3 = 1,000  | 2^10 = 1,024  |
| Megabyte | 10^6 = 1,000,000 | 2^20 = 1,048,576 |
| Gigabyte | 10^9 = 1,000,000,000 | 2^30 = 1,073,741,824 |
| Terabyte | 10^12 = 1,000,000,000,000 | 2^40 = 1,099,511,627,776 |
| Petabyte | 10^15 = 1,000,000,000,000,000 | 2^50 = 1,125,899,906,842,624 |
| Exabyte | 10^18 = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 | 2^60 = 1,152,921,504,606,846,976 |
| Zettabyte | 10^21 = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 | 2^70 = 1,180,591,620,717,411,303,424 |
| Yottabyte | 10^24 = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 | 2^80 = 1,208,925,819,614,629,174,706,176 |
- IP: specifies the **format of the packets** that are sent and received among routers and end system.
- what is the internet?
1. hardware aspect: coaxial cable, copper wire, optical fiber, radio spectrum, router and switch.
2. software aspect: packets switches, protocol
3. entirely different angle: an infrastructure that provides services to applications.
